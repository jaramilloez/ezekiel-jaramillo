        <div className="py-2">
          Hello! I'm Ezekiel, a devoted Full Stack Engineer with a passion for
          tinkering. Growing up in Ogden, Utah, I developed a strong foundation
          in problem-solving and practical skills.
        </div>
        <div className="py-2">
          I've had the opportunity to explore diverse projects and continuously
          expand my technical expertise from my personal websites that have been
          created from scratch, start to finish, which is something I'm
          knowledgeable at and very proud of. My passion drives me to refine my
          skills and improve my solutions.
        </div>
        <div className="py-2">
          My interest for exploring new technologies has inspired me to create
          many kinds of websites including one for mechanical engineering,
          recipes, tasks, and many others. Each experience has provided
          opportunities to expand my technical skills and push the boundaries of
          innovation.
        </div>
        <div className="py-2">
          When I'm not immersed in coding, I enjoy reading, playing video games,
          going to the gym, rock climbing, and cycling.
